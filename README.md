# Berni-s-CS-scraper
This program scrapes steam market jsons

The program reads a list of steam marketplace links e.g.: 
http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/578080/SURVIVOR%20CRATE
http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/578080/WANDERER%20CRATE
.
.
.

Afterwards the program will extract median price, lowest(?) and volume for the items
and appends those values to a .csv file. 

Also will the program plot graphs for the values and the items. 
This function is atm very rudamentary and has to be refined in the future. 

TO DO: Add some number outputs.
